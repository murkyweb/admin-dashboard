# Admin Dashboard

An admin dashboard made only using grid.

In this project I learned about nesting grids, fractional units, dynamic minimum and maximum sizes, using auto-fit or auto-fill for creating a grid with dynamic number of columns and rows.

This project was created for the [Admin Dashboard assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css/lessons/admin-dashboard) as part of The Odin Project.
